to get the per pixel RSME, divide the displayed RSME by 3600 (each was using 60x60 subimages)

for each map, a training set and a validation set were generated and used, one full image each.  However, I suspect that these sets were identical, as I was unable to find any noise generation or other random elements within the map generation programs.
